A few days ago we saw a new update on Chromecast which brought [games for the family]("https://github.com/malmstein/AndroidTVExplorer"). The main goal of it is to show other
use cases for Chromecast, this not just about casting a video but about making the most of all the capabilities of the device.

Interesting enough, I [gave a talk at Droidcon UK]("https://github.com/malmstein/AndroidTVExplorer") where one could see a simple Tic Tac Toe game. Does this sound good? Bare with me!
