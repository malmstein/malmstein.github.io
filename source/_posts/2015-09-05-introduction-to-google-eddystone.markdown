Bluetooth beacons are transmitters that use Bluetooth Low Energy 4.0 to broadcast signals that can be heard by compatible or smart devices.  These transmitters can be powered by batteries or a fixed power source such as a USB adapter. When a smart device is in a beaconâ€™s proximity, the beacon will automatically recognize it and will be able to interact with that device.

# What's the Google Eddystone project

Eddystone is a protocol specification that defines a Bluetooth low energy (BLE) message format for proximity beacon messages. It describes several different frame types that may be used individually or in combinations to create beacons that can be used for a variety of applications.
