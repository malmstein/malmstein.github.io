Hello, my name is David Gonz√°lez and I'm an Android Software Craftsman. Do you think that word is too arrogant? It may be, one can say that this whole
[Software Craftsmanship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship) is just another stupid trend. One can also say that the fact that there a
[manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) does not prove anything either.

The truth is, I consider myself something else than a developer. Asking questions, raising the bar, caring about the details, learning from the best
and speaking about it at all the conferences and events I can.

4 years ago I was hit by Android, it was about time for my University dissertation and a teacher whom I'll always be thankful showed me this thing called
Android which was supposed to be a big thing... a couple of days after I started to write an app which was going to alert the user when the proximity to
a bar (still Spanish after all) was smaller than a specified distance.

Once the dissertation was finished I quit my job and stated to work with an agency named Kirubs where I wrote my firsts applications
ready for production. There I learned how to be a self driven professional, being the only Android guy in a team can be such a big challenge and doing so for over a year
gave me the confidence I needed to take on a higher challenge.

* Calp: Tourist guide application from the City of Calp [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kirubs.calp)
* VirtualFace: Social network. Like Facebook but with Augmented Reality... dunno why Mark didn't buy this [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kirubs.apps.virtualface)
* Sicur: International Security Safety & Fire Exhibition [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kirubs.apps.sicur)
* Solan de Cabras: Helps you find the closest interesting points recommended by the famout mineral water brand [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.kirubs.solandecabras)
* The Creators Project: The ones from Vice, it was a partnership with an agency but the application was never published.
* FashionTV: Again a partnership with an agency, an application made for FashionTV channel enthusiasts.
* La Casa del Libro: A very challenging and high profile project. Bring the whole library of one of the biggest book sellers in Spain to the smartphone [Google Play]("https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tagus")

That was almost 18 months of intense development, not focusing on quality but on quantity so a decision needed to be made. A new possibility arose, this
time focused on quality and on just one project. It was my opportunity to dedicate myself to one product, being part of the whole process from conceptualisation
to market.

The company was Blink Booking in Madrid. That place got me the opportunity to learn about new technologies, work in a team fully focused on quality and being able to play an important role
in all the decisions made. Everything related to the Android application was running under my supervision, from whiteboard to deployment.

It was an amazing experience and the exit was quite successful since Groupon acquired the company. [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sbits.blink)

Being able to see a product grow from nothing to 100.000 downloads in just 7 months was an amazing experience, it helped me understand how some decisions may affect the business goals
and react upon mistakes. All that knowledge was the main reason that took me to the next step in my career, the place where I've stepped up the game and became what I am right now,
[Novoda](http://www.novoda.com).

This blog is where I write about my passions, experiences and mistakes... yes mistakes, because that's from what I've learnt the most.
