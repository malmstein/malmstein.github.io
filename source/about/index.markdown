Hello, my name is David Gonz√°lez and I'm an Android Software Craftsman. Do you think that word is too arrogant? It may be, one can say that this whole
[Software Craftsmanship](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_craftsmanship) is just another stupid trend. One can also say that the fact that there is a
[manifesto](http://manifesto.softwarecraftsmanship.org/) does not prove anything either.

5 years ago I was hit by Android, it was about time for my University dissertation and a teacher whom I'll always be thankful showed me this thing called
Android which was supposed to be a big thing... a couple of days after I started to write an app which alerter the user when the proximity to
a bar (still Spanish after all) was smaller than a specified distance.

The truth is, I consider myself a curious creature. I like to ask questions and I've been lucky enough to [learn from the best](http://novoda.com/). The evolution at **Novoda** has been amazing, starting as a Junior developer I've been raising the bar, caring about the details and taking care of the products. Now I'm a Technical Product Owner, [Google Developer Expert for Android](https://developers.google.com/experts/people/david-gonz-lez) and I'm in love with public speaking.

This blog is where I write about my passions, experiences and mistakes... yes mistakes, because that's from what I've learnt the most.
